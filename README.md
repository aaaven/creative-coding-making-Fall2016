## Creative Coding and Making
This is an interactive media and design fundmentel course design and developped for WPP school, Shanghai Art & Design Academy. I re-designed and improved "[Make Design Interactive, Spring 2016](https://github.com/aaaven/Make-Design-Interact-Spring2016)" with more supporting materials and code examples.

-- this is an achieve of all class materials including syllabus design, schedule and (part of) student project documentation. 

-- and the course is further polished at Fall 2017 and renamed as "[Make Design Interact](https://github.com/aaaven/Make-Design-Interact-Fall2017)" (Fall 2017), or in Chinese "让设计互动起来！"
